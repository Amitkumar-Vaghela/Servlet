# Servlet Project

## Overview
This project demonstrates the use of Java Servlets to create dynamic web applications. Servlets are server-side Java programs that handle client requests and generate responses, often in the form of HTML.

## Features
- **Request Handling**: Handles GET and POST requests.
- **Session Management**: Implements session tracking and management.
- **Form Data Processing**: Parses and processes form data submitted by the user.
- **Database Interaction**: Connects to a database to store and retrieve data (optional).
- **MVC Architecture**: Follows the Model-View-Controller design pattern (if applicable).

- **src/main/java**: Contains your Java Servlet classes.
- **webapp/WEB-INF/web.xml**: Deployment descriptor for configuring servlets and mapping URLs.
- **webapp/index.jsp**: The entry point for the application, serving as the main view.
- **lib/**: Optional directory for external libraries (like JDBC drivers).

## Prerequisites
- **Java Development Kit (JDK)**: Make sure you have JDK installed (version 8 or higher).
- **Apache Tomcat**: A servlet container to deploy and run your application.
- **Maven/Gradle**: For dependency management (optional).

## Getting Started

1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/
cd your-repository-name

2. Compile and Build the Project
 mvn clean install

3. Deploy to Tomcat
Copy the generated WAR file (from the target/ directory if using Maven) to the webapps folder of your Tomcat installation.
Start the Tomcat server.

4. Access the Application
Open your web browser and go to:
 http://localhost:8080/your-webapp-name
